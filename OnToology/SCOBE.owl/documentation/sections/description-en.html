Fig. 1 presents the main concepts and relationships associated with the representation of benchmarking that is adopted in SCOBE. The main elements of a benchmarking project that are identified in SCOBE are: (a) The entities of the supply chain whose practices or performance are going to be compared against the benchmarks; (b) The group of entities whose performance is to be analyzed in the study, called the benchmarking group; (c) The criteria with which the performance is evaluated and/or the benchmarking group is classified; and (d) The results that are obtained.

  Fig. 1. SCOBE main concepts and relationships

The benchmarking domain is organized along the three dimensions that are depicted in Fig. 1. Its left hand side portion includes the basic elements that characterize a benchmarking project. The central part comprises classes that represent elements that are employed in the analysis that is carried out on a benchmarking group. Finally, the portion on the right includes entities that capture the information that is obtained as a reference from the study that is performed. A more exhaustive description of SCOBE can be found in [2].
