<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The supply chain benchmarking sub-ontology (SCOBE) is a subontology of SCONTO (Supply Chain Ontology), which formally describes a supply chain based on the SCOR de facto standard [1]. SCOBE focuses on the description of concepts that are related with benchmarking and captures the information related to benchmarking projects. It includes the concepts related to the essential information of a project, such as the characterization of the studied entities, the criteria used to find the desired benchmarking references, the type of analysis carried out on the performance data, as well as the practices and benchmarks that are found.
